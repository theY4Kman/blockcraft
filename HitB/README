Hole in the Blocks
==================

This game is based off Brain Wall (aka Hole in the Wall, Human Tetris). A design is cut out of a wall, and the player must build the correct block structure in front of the Kinect to match the design. The structure the player builds appears in Minecraft and slides towards the wall. If it fits, the player wins the level and advances. If it doesn't, theeeey're OUT!
